## General:

My work on characters and items consisted of following:
1. Retopology of the models (all characters and some of the items)
2. Rigging and weighting of the characters with rigify addon (blend file is provided)
3. Making workflow for artist to follow in regards to uv mapping and texturing
4. Custom Shader and material setup for characters and items
5. Devising a way to have multiple characters sharing same body but have differend hair, noses, ears, skin color etc.
